# ShadowGuard 🛡️

AI-Powered Threat Detection and Risk Assessment System (Prototype)

## Overview

ShadowGuard is a prototype AI-based security system designed to analyze user messages in real time and detect potential risks such as malicious intent, unsafe instructions, or policy violations. It combines Large Language Model (LLM) intelligence with backend risk evaluation logic to provide safer and more controlled AI interactions.

This project demonstrates how AI guardrails can be implemented practically in conversational systems.

## Project Status

🚧 Prototype / Proof of Concept
This project is an experimental implementation intended for learning, demonstration, and hackathon use. It is not production-ready.

## How It Works

1. User submits a message through the interface
2. The message is analyzed using an LLM for intent and context
3. Backend logic assigns a risk level (Low / Medium / High)
4. Based on the risk:

   - Message is allowed, warned, or blocked

5. An explanation and recommended action are generated

## Key Features

- Context-aware message analysis
- Real-time risk classification
- Explainable AI responses
- Backend-controlled decision logic
- Modular and scalable architecture

## Use Cases

- Secure AI chatbots
- Content moderation systems
- Educational platforms
- Demonstration of responsible AI guardrails

## Tech Stack

- Large Language Model (LLM)
- Python-based backend
- API-driven architecture
- Web-based chatbot interface

## Disclaimer

ShadowGuard is a prototype project created for academic, hackathon, and experimental purposes. The risk detection logic and responses may not cover all real-world scenarios.
